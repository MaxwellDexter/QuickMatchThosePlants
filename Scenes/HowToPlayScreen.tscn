You're a volunteer at the Global Association Of Greenhouse Mirror Symmetry ([i]GAOMGS[/i]) and you are tasked with ensuring that all greenhouses are up to standard!

In front  you will see the desired sequence of plants. Behind you are the plants that must match the pattern!.
[i]Click[/i] on the plants to cycle them and complete the mirrored sequence!
Once you are satisfied with your assessment, click on the [i]large green button[/i] to journey to the next greenhouse.

Remember that the sequence must be [i]mirrored[/i] for it to be correct, so be sure to use the spin button to flip between the two sides.

Unfortunately, it is unsafe to assess greenhouses at night, so you must complete as many assessments as you can in one day! The [i]faster[/i] you complete the assessments, the more clout you will gather. Share your scores in the itch.io comment section and see who is the best assessor!"
